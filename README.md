# CS-353-Student-Registration-System
CS-353 Database Term Project
Student Registration System / Group 29

The proposed program is a Student Academic Information Registration System that
allows instructors, teaching assistants (TA) and students to access course-related queries.
The system will provide instructors with a platform for offering courses, defining
requirements for courses and grading for assessments. TA's will grade labs, projects, and
homework assignments. Students will be able to track the performance and attendance of
their course, enroll and withdraw courses and submit their assignments.<br>
Users will initially sign up to register themselves for an account. The system users will have
three separate accounts i.e. instructors, TAs and students. User-made accounts will be
registered using email addresses and passwords, each giving a unique identification.
In a single semester, instructors will select a list of courses they will be offering and will
choose the sections of these courses to allocate the schedule of lectures. They will then
create syllabuses for each course and publish in this system. Throughout the semester,
instructors will update the exam grades, attendances for each student, enter assignments
and announcements to the system for each course, give tasks for TA’s and prepare their
personal information.<br>
The teaching assistants would be assigned the job of grading a project, lab work and
homework assignments for students. They will join these grades in the program during the
semester. The TA's will also show their weekly office hours for students to visit them, and
ask questions in person, or students may also ask questions via the given email address.
Finally, the students will use this system to show their course performance which includes
the grades they receive for each component of the course grading and will also report their
attendance results. Before the start of the semester, students will be eligible to enroll for
courses and to withdraw from a specific course until the deadline to be determined later by
instructors. Students may also submit their assignments to the TA for evaluation. Students
may apply to another university for a student exchange program.<br>
While our system does not accurately represent the university structures, it will essentially
reminisce how it looks like a university database system.
